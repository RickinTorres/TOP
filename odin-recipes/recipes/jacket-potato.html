  <p>These crispy jacket potatoes are like a baked potato, but better. Serve with butter and sour cream.</p>

  <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>6 medium russet potatoes</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil, or as needed</li>
    <li>Â¼ teaspoon sea salt, or to taste</li>
    <li>1 pinch lemon-pepper seasoning, or to taste</li>
    <li>12 large squares aluminum foil</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Step-by-Step</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Gather ingredients. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Drizzle potatoes with a thin layer of oil. Sprinkle on sea salt and about 1/2 as much lemon-pepper seasoning.</li>
    <li>Wrap each potato in a square of foil, then wrap with a second square. Place foil-wrapped potatoes in a glass or ceramic baking dish.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the skins are crisp and the flesh is soft, 60 to 90 minutes.</li>
    <li>Serve with butter, sour cream, or any of your favorite toppings!</li>
